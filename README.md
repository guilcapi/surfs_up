## Summary
Looking at the results for the two months, it seems that both months, although 6 months apart, have similar means of temperatures while slightly lower temperatures in December (69 degrees Fahrenheit) and slightly higher temperatures in June (85 degrees Fahrenheit). Two additional queries I would perform to gather more weather data would be to graph out a bar graph and histogram to visualize the data and better understand where temperature most likely remains during these two months.
